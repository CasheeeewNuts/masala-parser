# Masala Parser: Javascript Parser Combinators

Fork of [masala-parser](https://github.com/masala/masala-parser) that provides the response in the map function.

Adding the response to the map function allows users to extract useful information regarding the offset of the token, and the current state of the parser. I've added this to the callback and updated the type declarations to make this change.
